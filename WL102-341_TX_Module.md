## Antenna selection Description
#### General application mode
For general application mode ,the antenna can directly adopt the general specifications from the market;

The specific information as follows:

The antenna’s core of conductor diameter(including the Antenna skin): 1.0mm,(except the Antenna skin): 0.5mm ;

The wire length of weld end: 17.5mm, the wire length of antenna terminal: 9.5mm;

The diameter of antenna winding (including the Antenna skin):5mm;

The turn number of winding: 15 turns

#### The special enhancement mode

The general application mode cannot satisfy if you need farther communication distance, so the special enhancement mode can receive farther communication distance, and the specific information as follows:

433Mhz Antenna

The antenna’s core of conductor diameter (including the Antenna skin): 1.0mm; (except the Antenna skin): 0.35mm

The wire length of weld end: 12mm

The diameter of antenna winding (except the Antenna skin):3.0mm;

The turn number of winding: 26 turns; The length of the winding: 36mm
